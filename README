This is unstable software I developed in a hurry while learning Clojure.
Use it at your own risk!

It worked for me to migrate my Google Notebook items to Delicious, if you want
to try it yourself, just run

./bin/repl.sh

and you'll be prompted for the path to the HTML export of your Google Notebook,
and for your delicious credentials.
Beware: password is displayed on screen when typed!!

All items created in delicious have the tag google-notebook-import, which lets
you easily identify them, to possibly delete them if migration failed.
All items created are private.

The apache  httpclient jar has been modified to accept cookies from other
domains, which was needed here (requests sent to del.icio.us, cookie's domain
is delicious.com). You can find it as http://www.nsa.be/nb_exporter
